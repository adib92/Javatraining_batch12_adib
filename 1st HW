Java claims that it is a platform independent but under what certain condition it changes its behavior?

Ans:Platform independent language means once compiled you can execute the program on any platform (OS). Java is platform independent. 
Because the Java compiler converts the source code to bytecode, which is Intermediate Language. Bytecode can be executed on any
platform (OS) using JVM (Java Virtual Machine) 

Java is platform independent with the help of JVM. In Java, the main point here is that the JVM depends on the operating system – so if 
you are running Mac OS X you will have a different JVM than if you are running Windows or some other operating system. This fact can be 
verified by trying to download the JVM for your particular machine – when trying to download it, you will be given a list of JVM’s 
corresponding to different operating systems, and you will obviously pick whichever JVM is targeted for the operating system that you 
are running. So, we can conclude that JVM is platform dependent and it is the reason why Java is able to become “Platform Independent”.
